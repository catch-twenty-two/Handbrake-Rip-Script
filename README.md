I found the gui for Handbrake limiting. I needed something that would make it easy to copy a TV show on DVD to my NAS folder.  Thats what this script does, it takes input as Season, Episode and Title then automatically does the rest of the work for you by ripping all the titles on multiple DVD's to a specified directory. Developed using a Synology NAS and Mac OS X Lion should work on linux as well except for the eject disk command.

Requires Handbrake CLi to be installed and in the path.
